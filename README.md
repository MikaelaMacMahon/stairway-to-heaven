## Project to extract physical meaning from accelerometer and gyroscope data
- Sucessfully converted data to global coordinates and reduced influence of bias instability and random walk on angular distance, velocity and displacement. Noise characterized and reduced by applying allan variance analysis, allowing for the identification of landings, stairs and floors from data captured at the top of the foot.
